## WEB Demo
The source code contains a complete WEB demo (also is the one
hosted on [our demo page](https://approach0.xyz/demo/)) that
you can set up on your own machine.

### Install and config Nginx/PHP
For convenience, here list steps to install a HTTP service
(given Nginx as example) that will accepts client AJAX request
from 80 port and use a php script to relay this request to
a running searchd program.

For Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install nginx php-fpm
```

Check if `.sock` file exists
```
$ ls /run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock
```

Edit config file
```
$ sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Uncomment php related lines:
```
 ...
	location ~ \.php$ {
		include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
		fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
	}
 ...
```

Restart php-fpm and nginx:
```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/php7.0-fpm restart
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Write a simple php file on `/var/www/html/test.php`
```
$ cat /var/www/html/test.php
<?php
echo 'hello world';
?>
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1/test.php` to see if `hello world` is
printed. If it is not, a useful trick is to enable
display\_errors in php.inf
```
$ vi /etc/php/7.0/fpm/php.ini
```
and set `display_errors = On`. Then restart php-fpm and nginx
again to figure out what is going wrong.

### Link or copy WEB files
Now that php service is running, put our WEB source files to
HTTP root directory.

```sh
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ ln -s $PROJECT/demo/web ./demo
```

Then you should be able to visit `http://127.0.0.1/demo` page.

### Install php-curl
The `search-relay.php` in web directory is using php-curl to relay
requests from 80 to searchd, the latter is running on port 8921 in
default. So make sure php-curl is installed.
```
$ sudo apt-get install php-curl
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

(the searchd binding port is hard-coded, so is the port in
search-relay.php, currently if you want to modify this port number,
edit `searchd/config.h` and `demo/web/search-relay.php` and then
rebuild searchd)

### Run searchd in background

Install tmux for keeping searchd running in a detached session
(so that searchd can keep running even if we exit the shell).
```
$ sudo apt-get install tmux
$ cd $PROJECT/searchd
$ tmux new -d -s searchd_session './run/searchd.out -i ~/large-index'
```

At this point, you should be able to get search results back after
entering queries in demo page.

When you need to shutdown searchd, attach back this session:
```
$ tmux list-sessions
$ tmux attach -t searchd_session
```
and hit Ctrl-C.

### Setup HTTPS (optional)
Our demo page is a `https` URL, this section records how to setup
https service (using [letâ€™s encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
service) in Nginx for whoever needs to maintain our demo page.
```
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/t-k-/letsencrypt-auto.git
$ cd letsencrypt-auto
$ vi letsencrypt.conf
```
change variable `DOMAIN_DIR` to `/var/www/html`.

If `python` command is not found (does not link to python3), issue:
```
$ ln -s `which python3` /usr/bin/python
```

Run *let's encrypt* script:
```
$ ./letsencrypt.sh
 ...
$ ls
account.key   domain.chained.crt  domain.csr  letsencrypt.conf  lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem
acme_tiny.py  domain.crt          domain.key  letsencrypt.sh
```

Upon success, set nginx config file:
```
$ ln -s `pwd`/domain.chained.crt /var/www/html/
$ ln -s `pwd`/domain.key /var/www/
$ vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Add
```
 ...
    # SSL configuration

    listen 443 ssl default_server;
    listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
    ssl_certificate /var/www/html/domain.chained.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /var/www/html/domain.key;
 ...
```
on server scope.

Restart http server
```
$ systemctl restart nginx
```

At this point, https port is opened.
