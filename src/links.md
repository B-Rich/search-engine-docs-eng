### Demo
To help you quickly have an idea of this project,
a demo is hosted on
[https://approach0.xyz/demo/](https://approach0.xyz/demo/)

Preview in a GIF:

![](https://github.com/approach0/search-engine-docs-eng/raw/master/img/clip.gif)

This demo currently has indexed 1000 pages from
[http://math.stackexchange.com](http://math.stackexchange.com),
with 30 posts per page.

The short-term goal is to index all the documents from
math.stackexchange.com, but that would not be done until
the effectiveness is fully tuned. Also, efficiency needs
further improvements and index size needs to be lowered by
using delta-encoding on math-index (see TODOs).

### Code
Our code is hosted on GitHub:

[https://github.com/approach0/search-engine](https://github.com/approach0/search-engine)

Please create an issue on our GitHub repo if you have any
problem.
The code is open-source under MIT, we are open to pull request
on Github too.

### Old Repo
This project is originated from a previous prototype (named Cowpie)
of **math-only** search engine
(
see [this original repo](https://bitbucket.org/t-k-/cowpie/)
and its [research paper code reference](https://github.com/t-k-/opmes)
).
These old repositories are for reference only.
Current project is a complete rewrite based on previous ideas.
