### Old Repo
This project is originated from a previous prototype (named Cowpie)
of **math-only** search engine
(
see [this original repo](https://bitbucket.org/t-k-/cowpie/)
and its [research paper code reference](https://github.com/t-k-/opmes)
).
These old repositories are for reference only.
Current project is a complete rewrite based on previous ideas.
