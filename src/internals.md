## Internals
Some old papers/posters describe in detail what our search
methods are. You may find useful to read these resources first:

1. [ECIR16 Slides](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/raw/master/opmes/ECIR16-OPMES-slides-handouts.pdf)
2. [ECIR16 Poster](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/raw/master/opmes/ECIR16-Wei-Poster-publish.pdf)
3. [ECIR16 Paper](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/blob/master/opmes/ecir2016.pdf)
4. [My graduate thesis](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/raw/master/opmes/thesis-ref.pdf)

Although Approach0 is a complete rewrite based on previous
prototype (OPMES), the basic ideas of searching math expression
remain unchanged in both systems. Approach0 mainly makes an advance
in the following aspects on top of OPMES:

1. Combine math-only search with fulltext search
2. Adds some feature (e.g. math expression wildcards)
3. Better code framework

There are a whole bunch of topics to be explained on the
internals of this project.
I will write more details on the internals of Approach0
in the future, especially when somebody has requested.
