## Internals
There are a whole bunch of topics to be explained on the
internals of this project.

Some old papers/posters describe in detail what our search
methods are. You may find useful to read these resources first:

1. [ECIR16 Slides](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/raw/master/opmes/ECIR16-OPMES-slides-handouts.pdf)
2. [ECIR16 Poster](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/raw/master/opmes/ECIR16-Wei-Poster-publish.pdf)
3. [ECIR16 Paper](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/blob/master/opmes/ecir2016.pdf)
4. [My graduate thesis](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/raw/master/opmes/thesis-ref.pdf)

Although Approach0 is a complete rewrite based on previous
prototype (OPMES), the basic idea of searching math expression
is remain unchanged.

I will write more details on the internals of Approach0
in the future, especially when somebody has requested.
